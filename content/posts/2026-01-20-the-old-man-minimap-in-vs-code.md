If you don't use the minimap in VS code you probably turned it off a while ago (like me). I thought it was small and useless unless your code has a very distinct structure. But it it's mostly 

It's kinda like sublime's minimap:

## But...

I was recently perusing the options in VS code and noticed you can change the size of the minimap. There's 3 settings and the last one makes me feel like an old man pulling out a magnifying glass to read a newspaper (almost there practically).

I think sublime's map is a little more crisp, but this is nice. I can actually see the code structure!

For comparison, see these two screenshots of the same code structure (don't even read the code):
- A go struct
- A medium size function (20ish)
- 2 small functions (2ish)
- Another go Struct

I think I prefer VS Code's blurrier but bigger representation.

## A nice touch to an arguably usable feature
I don't know if I should "depend" on recognizing code structure. Feels like re-reading a book so much you know what happens by the structure of the paragraphs. In one man projects it's probably very comfy until someone else comes along and starts adding and --more annoyingly-- moving things around. Then I can tell them to get off my porch.
