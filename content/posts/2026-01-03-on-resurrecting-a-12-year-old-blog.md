title: 'On Resurrecting a 12 year old blog'

This used to be an old blog of mine. So much has changed in 12 years.

## Then and now 
It used hosted on Github Pages. Now it's on Cloudflare pages (or is it Cloudflare Workers?)

It used to run using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (ruby). Now it's running on [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (golang). The first public release of hugo was [July 5, 2013](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.7)

It's not just the tech that changed. My life is totally different. Back then I was just finishing college, I was broke, and I had no job or life prospects. Now I'm employed, financially stable, and moved to another country. It's humbling the amount of change that can happen in a dozen years. I do weigh about the same, thankfully!

I obviously resurrected this blog with the help of AI. Moving the project from two frameworks would not be hard but certainly tedious. I also took the opportunity to replace the plain banner that was at the top of the page with something a little more fancy. It uses [zdog](https://zzz.dog/) and it's plugin [zfont](https://jaames.github.io/zfont/). That little bit of flair took about 2 hours. 

I don't know if using these AI tools makes me faster. The real benefit is that I can iterate quicker and most importantly the barrier to start a feature is melted away into an exploratory conversation. 

> I used to suffer a lot with mustering the willpower to start tasks. The biggest productivity benefit I get from AI coding agents is that the first step is just to write out what I need to do. Sometimes I even skip using the tool after writing a prompt. Weird

## Next dozen years?

The list of changes is longer than it is interesting to read through (or write about). It does make me excited for the future. I'm already very satisfied with the amount I can travel on a budget, I can buy on a salary, and knowledge I can access with the basic utilities. It sucks that real estate in cities and healthcare is expensive. The good with the bad and so on.

The future is uncertain. I hope there won't be large scale war or ecosystem collapse but I'm hopeful in peoples ability to cooperate. It may seem tone deaf (the United States just bombed Venezuela to get oil) but it's my silly little belief.
